A Gaussian beam can be uniquely described by the waist size and
waist position of the beam. Here, we investigate these important
beam parameters as well as other useful derived parameters such
as the radius of curvature of the phase front, the Rayleigh range,
and the diffraction angle, and we learn how to obtain these
parameters from Finesse.
