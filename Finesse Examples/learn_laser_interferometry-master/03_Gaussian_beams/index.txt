<p>
The transverse spatial distribution of a beam is introduced,
that is, the amplitude and phase of the beam are no longer
constant in the plane perpendicual to the optical axis. This
plane is spanned by the x and y-axes. 
</p>
<p>
In Finesse the spatial distributions are described by
Hermite-Gaussian (defualt) or Laguerre-Gaussian
functions.
