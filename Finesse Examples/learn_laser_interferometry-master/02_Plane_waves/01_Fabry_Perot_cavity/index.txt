A Fabry-Perot cavity or Fabry-Perot interferometers is one of the
fundamental building blocks of many laser interferometers.

A Fabry-Perot cavity consists of two mirrors facing each other. The
mirrors form an optical resonator in which a light field, e.g. a laser
beam, can be resonantly enhanced. The notebooks in this directory 
explain and investigate some of the most important properties of a
Fabry-Perot cavity, using a plane-wave analysis.
