The difference is that the reflected field now has 0 phase shift when the cavity is on resonance, compared to 180 degrees phase shift for the over-coupled cavity. The reason is that the smaller circulating field and the smaller transmittance of the input mirror allows less leakage back out through the input mirror, thus, the resulting reflected field is now dominated by the field directly reflected by the input mirror."
