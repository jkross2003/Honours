For developing a basic understanding of an optical system it
is useful to ignore the shape of the laser beam and of the
optics. We refer to this method as 'plane wave analysis', ignoring
the x and y coordinates and evaluating the field only along the
z-axis.

<p>
The mathematical description of such systems forms
a useful basis for developing a full model, including the beam shape,
later on.
