<p>
The Michelson is one of the fundamental building blocks of
advanced interferometers for gravitational wave detection.
</p>

<p>
In a Michelson interferometer an incoming laser beam is split into two
parts by a central beam splitter. The two beams propagate along two perpendicular
arms, each ending with a mirror. The beams are reflected back
towards the beam splitter where the they recombine. Any change in
the relative length of the interferometer arms results in a change
of the light intensity in the interferometer output.
